Overview
========

The OpenChariot project aims to provide a simple, easy to use, configure, and
extend set of services suitable for running a small business, home office, or
research lab with a focus on software development and documentation.

Key goals include:

- UNIX design philosophy is followed, OpenChariot shall be composed of small,
  modular components, each of which can stand alone if desired.
- Portability - OpenChariot should run on as many POSIX systems as possible.
- KISS - OpenChairiot should be easy to understand; an experienced UNIX user
  should be able to grok it fully within 1-3 days of study.
- Static - where web services are provided, they should always be static, this
  is for speed, simplicity, and performance.
