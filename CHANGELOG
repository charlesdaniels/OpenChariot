		  ocutil-getconfig
		* Add ocutil-validate-dep
		* Add ocutil-validate-dirs
		* ocutil-process-gitspool no longer tries to creae the spool

		* Implemented ocutil-generate-index
		* Fixed a bug where ocutil-update-be would write to /
		* Fixed a bug where ocutil-update-gitstats would cause

0.0.2-RC1:

	2017-06-28 - Charles Daniels:

		* OpenChariot now supports the git "dumb" http anonymous
		  git protocol for clones (but not pushes)
		* Implemented ocutil-update-dumb-http

	2017-07-03 - Charles Daniels:

		* Implemented installer script (install.pl)

	2017-07-03 - Matt Coley:

		* Added OpenChariot shared CSS theme

	2017-07-04 - Charles Daniels:

		* Installer and uninstaller now create
		  OC_PREFIX/lib/openchariot, and place the CSS theme therein.
		* ocutil-generate-index now uses the shared CSS theme.
		* ocutil-update-gitstats now uses the shared CSS theme.
		* Add boilerplate to ocutil-update-git-arr to use shared
		  CSS theme, but it's commented out for the time being, since
		  the OC CSS breaks the git-arr UI.
		* ocutil-update-be now uses the share CSS theme.
		* ocutil-update-git-arr now has more verbose output
		* ocutil-update-docs now uses .ocdoc.sh, rather than .clsdoc.sh
		  as it did previously, which was incorrect.
		* Many small bugfixes to ocutil-generate-index:

			* project documentation is now detected correctly
			* links to project documentation are now generated
			  correctly.
			* bug tracker state is now detected accurately (links
			  to the bug tracker are no longer generate if the
			  project does not have one).

		* OC_PREFIX is now set by the shared header.


	2017-08-06 - Charles Daniels:

		* Added support for home-directory installation;
		  ~/.local/share/openchariot can now be used as an installation
		  prefix.

		* Implemented oc_log_* functions for debug, info, warn, and
		  error, which should be used for log message from here on
		  on out.

			* oc_log_debug may be suppressed by setting
			  OC_SUPPRESS_DEBUG=YES in openchariot.cfg, which is
			  the default.

			* oc_log_info may be suppressed by setting
			  OC_SUPPRESS_INFO=YES in openchariot.cfg; the default
			  is NO (info logs are shown).

		* Installer now prints prefix path if the prefix does not
		  exist, rather than simply an error stating the prefix does
		  not exist.

		* Updated ocutil-update-gitstats to use new logging functions.

		* Fixed a bug in ocutil-update-gitstats where packed refs
		  were not detected correctly, and non-empty repositories
		  were being flagged as empty.

		* Implemented ocutil-mirrorfrom, which will create read-only
		  mirrors for each of a newline-delimited list of URLs given
		  in OC_PREFIX/etc/openchariot/mirrorfrom.list

			* This takes care of half of a68/fbd.

		* Implemented ocutil-mirrorto, which can force-mirror-push
		  a local repo to a remote one. Useful for mirroring projects
		  to GitHub and the like.

			* This takes care of the other half of a68/fbd.

0.0.2-RC2:

	2017-08-06 - Charles Daniels:

		* Fixed an issue where `make redist-pdf` would not actually
		  invoke the `build` rule, and thus would generate redist
		  tarballs that would break when installed.

		* Fixed an issue where the shared header used a syntax for
		  declaring functions that `sh` on FreeBSD 11 did not like.
		  This fixes a crash due to syntax error on FreeBSD 11,
		  and probably other systems.
