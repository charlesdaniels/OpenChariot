As of the 0.0.2 release (currently WiP), this issue has been resolved by
the following commits:

	479759d26c552a4a2c6e034f3f3ce15dfa8e77a8 Implemented ocutil-mirrorto.
	5ef575c1d7c7a1b70b6bb95b38114af33f55b2f1 Implemented ocutil-mirrorfrom and fixed a bug.

The desired functionality has been implemented, with the exception of modifying
the README/description on the remote host which is being pushed to. However,
since the remote end needs to have the repo already created, the suggestion
convention is to simply set the description appropriately when creating the
repo on the remote end.
