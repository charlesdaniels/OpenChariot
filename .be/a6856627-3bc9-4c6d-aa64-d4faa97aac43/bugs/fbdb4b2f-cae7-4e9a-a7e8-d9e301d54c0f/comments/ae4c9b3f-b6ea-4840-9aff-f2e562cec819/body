A feature should be added where a list of repositories can be provided in
a configuration file, and OpenChariot will produce a read-only mirror of these
repositories. A link should be added to the project index pointing to the
mirror list, which should be formatted similarly, but with a different
title indicating that it is a set of read-only mirrors.

The generation scripts need to be modified operate correctly on arbitrary
prefixes, so that the mirrored projects can be output in an alternate directory
from normal projects.
