Steps to reproduce:

Create a new empty git repository (eg. via gitspool), run
ocutil-update-gitstats, then ocutil-generate-index. A link to the statistics
page will be generated, but will result in a 403 forbidden error, presumably
because the index.html file does not exist. 

This can likely be fixed by having generate-index check for the existance of
index.html, rather than only the parent folder for the statistics page.
