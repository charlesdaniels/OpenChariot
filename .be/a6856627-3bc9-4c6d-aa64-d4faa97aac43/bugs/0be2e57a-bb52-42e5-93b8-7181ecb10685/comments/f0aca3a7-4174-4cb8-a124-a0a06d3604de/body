ocutil-spooler should use the & operator to span jobs in the background, then
use the jobs command to poll them for completion. Some thought will need to go
into how we test them for failure also. This may also require better logging
hygiene, as the log messages may wind up all jumbled together. This could
potentially increase performance a lot for multi-core systems, as for large
projects both gitstats and git-arr can be potentially be both long-running and
single threaded.

To take it a step further, it might be useful to apply the same treatment to
any ocutil commands that operate on multiple repos, like
ocutil-update-gitstats; each repo could be processed in parallel. It might be
useful to pull in GNU parallel to this end, so we avoid totally killing
systems with weak or single core CPUs.
