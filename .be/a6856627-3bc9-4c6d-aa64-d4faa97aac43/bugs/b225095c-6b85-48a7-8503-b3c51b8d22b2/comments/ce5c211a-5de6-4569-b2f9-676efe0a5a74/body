As part of the (currently WiP) 0.0.2 release, installation into
~/.local/share/openchariot is supported; this is to facilitate OpenChariot
development, and as a feature for those wishing to leverage OpenChariot as part
of their local development workflow (i.e. to get project statistics)

This functionality was tested on a macOS Sierra host. Some breadcrumbs for when
the documentation gets written:

* I had to set "path" in git-arr.conf to:

	path = /Users/myusername/.local/share/openchariot/git

* I used this config file:

	OC_MAGIC=OpenChariot
	OC_GITSPOOL=$HOME/.local/share/openchariot/var/openchariot/gitspool
	OC_GITSPOOL_PERM=775
	OC_GIT_USER=myusername
	OC_GIT_GROUP=staff
	OC_GIT_DIR=$HOME/.local/share/openchariot/git
	OC_GITSPOOL_GROUP=staff
	OC_WWW_ROOT=$HOME/.local/share/openchariot/var/www
	OC_WWW_USER=cad
	OC_WWW_GROUP=staff
	OC_WWW_PERM=755
	OC_LOGFILE=$HOME/.local/share/openchariot/var/log/openchariot.log
	OC_GIT_DUMB_HTTP=YES
	OC_GIT_DUMB_HTTP_DIR=$HOME/.local/share/openchariot/git

It would probably also be possible to automate this.

As far as dependencies, they all built and installed as on FreeBSD by
installing their dependencies from Homebrew.
