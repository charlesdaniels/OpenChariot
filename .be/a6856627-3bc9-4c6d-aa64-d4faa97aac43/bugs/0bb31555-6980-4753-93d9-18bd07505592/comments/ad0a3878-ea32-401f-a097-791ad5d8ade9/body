The configuration is no longer overwritten every time the program is installed.
However, I still maintain that it would be constructive to manage the
git-arr configuration internally in the future, possibly by wrapping
configuration values that should be exposed to the user in our own config file,
then generating a git-arr config every run based on this information.
