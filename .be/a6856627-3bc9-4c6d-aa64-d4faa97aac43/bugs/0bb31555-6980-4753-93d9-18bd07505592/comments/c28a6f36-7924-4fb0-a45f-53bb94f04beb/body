At present, the git-arr configuration is overwritten each time "make install"
is executed. This makes the upgrade path for installing updates versions of
OpenChariot uncomfortable if any changes have been made to the default.

To this end, we should probably either generate and manage the git-arr config
internally, and not let the user modify it, or just tell the user how to
configure it and provide a template. I am tending to lean towards the former.
