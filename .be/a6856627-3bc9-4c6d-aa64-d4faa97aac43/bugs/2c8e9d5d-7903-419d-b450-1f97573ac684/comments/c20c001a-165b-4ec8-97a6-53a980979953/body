Considerable work has gone towards this issue in the patch

493b80fe6f61fac7c2ffdf2b2c2038e5eccb0a97

As of this patch, all components use unified CSS theme, with the exception of
git-arr, to which I have added appropriate boilerplate, but disabled it for
now since the OC CSS theme clashes significantly with the git-arr UI.

Of further note, the documentation builder does not do anything special with
CSS - to that end documentation will use whatever CSS theme the pertinent build
script uses. I do not propose that we try to force our own CSS into
documentation built in this way, but propose that it might be useful to provide
themes for Sphinx, and possible other documentation builders, so that
OpenChariot users can have a consistent look and feel throughout their sites.

Note that the shard CSS theme now lives in src/web/openchariot.css, and further
that adding additional, component-specific CSS themes would be exceedingly
easy, as CSS injection is handled by each individual component update script.
