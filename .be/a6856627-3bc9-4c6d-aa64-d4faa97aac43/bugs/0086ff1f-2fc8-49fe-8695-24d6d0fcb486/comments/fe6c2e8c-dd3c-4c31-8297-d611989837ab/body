I have added a simple shell script which when executed, will emit a series of
export commands that can be executed in sh or compatbile, and encode the
configuration data for the OC install. Support for this needs to be added to
all of the pertinent scripts. The actual storage of the configuration should
probably be moved to some file in /etc and parsed by the shell script, this way
Python or Perl based OC modules that may be added in the future can parse the
config also.
