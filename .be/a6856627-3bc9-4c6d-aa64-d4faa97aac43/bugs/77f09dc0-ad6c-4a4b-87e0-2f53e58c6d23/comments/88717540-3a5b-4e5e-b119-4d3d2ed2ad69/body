CI/CD functionality should be added to OpenChariot. This will work similarly to
how documentation generation works - project will be able to contain a script
along the lines of .occi.sh which will be executed to produce a build and other
CI/CD information.

Unlike project documentation, build HTML and artifacts should be tracked on a
per-commit bases, rather than a per-repo basis. A config parameter should be
added to specify how far "back" (how many commits) to go when populating
missing CI/CD results.
